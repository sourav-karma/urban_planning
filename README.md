# urban_planning

This planning project was done for Anne II living district, Tartu, Estonia. As part of planning process, we prioritized creating new recreational activity spaces and commercial services to make Anne II more lively. With gravity model analysis, the accessibility to the services from different parts of Anne II is determined by taking population and spatial proximity into consideration. 

This is a group project that includes field data collection, use of open source geo-data, data from Tartu city government and consultation with professors and local community.
